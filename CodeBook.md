###Description:
'test_training-Mean_SD.csv' and 'Means_by_Subject-Activity.csv' are created by the script 'run_analysis.R'.  'test_training-Mean_SD.csv'  has all of the above mentioned variables ordered by activity and subject.  'Means_by_Subject-Activity.csv' has the means of all the above variables for each activity and each subject.  For step-by-step details on the process of how these files were created, see 'run_analysis.R'
